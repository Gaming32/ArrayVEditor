# How to contribute

When you create a fork for contributing, make sure you update the [`dev`](https://github.com/Gaming32/ArrayVEditor/tree/dev) branch.

## How development on this project works

New features get merged into the [`dev`](https://github.com/Gaming32/ArrayVEditor/tree/dev) branch. When we feel like enough progress has been made on `dev`, `dev` gets merged into the [`beta`](https://github.com/Gaming32/ArrayVEditor/tree/beta) branch, and a new *pre-*release is created on GitHub. When we feel that `beta` is stable and ready for a new release, we merge it into the [`main`](https://github.com/Gaming32/ArrayVEditor/tree/main) branch and create a new release on GitHub.
